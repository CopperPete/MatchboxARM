This example shows how to programm the internal flash memory.
It reads the data from a specific flash memory location
and compare with the value defined in our program.
If data is the same that print to USART that data is the same,
if memory location is empty, prints to USART that location is empty.
If data is different that our defined value, it prints to USART a message
that data is different.

To check the example you need an USAB-TTL adapter.
